    Each of the Dendrogram graphs perfectly matches with the correlation matrix because the items
most closely grouped together on the Dendogram have the highest intensity on the correlation matrix.
This observation is consistent across all of the different features, especially amongnst the ones
with the highest correlations. Interestingly, these observations still exist for the lower thresholds
but are much less quantifiably observable.
